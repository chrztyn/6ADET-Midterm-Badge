## Reflections

**Domingo, Jasmeen Clarisse – QA Tester**

Identifying edge cases that would expose real issues across three modules with different logic required more critical thinking than initially expected. This made me realize that thorough testing involves more than verifying basic functionality, and through this role I developed a more systematic approach to quality assurance while handling the edge case testing, debugging, and refinements for the project.

**Lapuz, Mary Micah G. – UI Developer**

Maintaining visual consistency across all three modules was challenging because adjusting one layout detail would often affect another, requiring multiple rounds of refinement. Through this I learned how much precision UI development demands and I gained more confidence working with Flutter widgets and building layouts that are both clean and intentional.

**Payawal, Kyle Eishley G. – System Architect**

Designing the architecture before the modules were fully defined required thinking ahead and accounting for behaviors that were not yet implemented. This pushed me to apply abstraction and polymorphism beyond just a theoretical level and I gained a clearer understanding of how early architectural decisions influence the overall structure of a project.

**Quiambao, Maxene P. – Module Developer**

Managing dynamic components with properly encapsulated state had its complexities, one being the BMI height input that required a dropdown solution to support both cm and feet formats properly. This strengthened my understanding of how encapsulation holds up under more complex logic and I was responsible for the module implementation and internal logic throughout the project.

**Yunun, Christine Mae D. – Module Developer / Project Lead**

Taking on both module development and project coordination required constant task switching, but it ultimately gave me a better understanding of how all the components of the project connected. Being involved in both the technical and organizational side made collaboration more effective and I learned that contributing to development while leading the team results in a stronger sense of accountability over the final output.
